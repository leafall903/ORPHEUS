"""A player's hero body run on the server, and the statescript frames that keep the owning client's
prediction.

The client predicts its own body: it runs the networked nodes of the body's instances from its own input
and records undo history per command frame. It does not run the server's part (the Entries of instances
the server made, the instances' first states), and it rolls back whatever the server does not confirm. So
the server runs the same graphs from the same input (runtime.py) and sends, for every command frame K it
has processed, an owner frame with C = 1 and CmFD = K: everything that differs from what the client last
confirmed, and every instance's pending timers.

Frames, in order:
1. the body's create (match.py);
2. a plain full frame (H = 0): every instance and every variable, every state off. The client binds its
   own instances 1..N and makes the server's (the weapon manager, the weapons, the SubScript children);
3. once it arrived: an owner delta with C = 0 at the newest command frame K: every state that is on, the
   variables that have bindings, the timers. Retry the same chunk until it is acknowledged;
4. once acknowledged and SETTLE_FRAMES have passed, an owner delta with C = 1 for every new K.
A correction describes the change since the last chunk the client acknowledged, plus everything the
chunks sent after it carried (the client may have applied them), so it needs no resend.
