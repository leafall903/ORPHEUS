"""Predicted projectiles: what the server sends so that the owner's own Helix Rocket and Biotic Field canister
live, explode and leave their field (addresses are the PC client's, build 104319).

The lease:
- The owner's client shoots a projectile volley itself only under a lease on its body: component 90
  (MECPredictor, accessor 0x7FF789AE5B90: word 1 bit 26), field m_leaseBlocks (type 0x7FF78BFE9200, +120,
  owner-only flag 0x10), an array of LeaseBlock {u64 definition, u32 start, u32 stop, u32 startEntityID,
  u8 perFrame} (type 0x7FF78BFE9140). The allocator (0x7FF789AE59D0) takes the first block of the
  projectile's definition with start <= f < stop for command frame f and gives the id 0xA0000000 |
  startEntityID + (f - start) * perFrame (one more per further projectile of that frame). No block, no
  projectile. On the wire the array is an aligned u32 count and 21 bytes per block.
- Each body gets its own id range per definition (slot, definition), so no two bodies ever share an id, and
  ids move on with the frame, so a new body never repeats a recent one (the client ignores a destroyed id
  for 30 s).

Confirmation (0x7FF78969D4CD):
- The predicted projectile stays only if the server confirms it: a create record of the same id sets its
  component 91 +28 = 1 and changes nothing else (a create for an id the client does not have yet makes an
  unflown entity at the record's place, and the client's own shot of that id is then refused). So the
  creates go out only once the client has acknowledged the owner frame that reported the volley (the
  client shoots the rocket at the frame of that owner frame, K, or at the press, f): lease(K) and
  lease(f).

The release (reader chain: ch2 0x7FF789A4A490 -> state 0x7FF789A34600 -> record 0x7FF789C78980):
- The client holds a networked rocket's explosion back for the server (072C, 1C86:
  m_delayCollisionEffectsBasedOnLatency). A ch2 projectile state for a frame ahead of the rocket's, alive,
  with an impact count, in the same entity block as the destroy, makes the destructor play it at the
  client's own impact point. So the server destroys a rocket a little after it would hit (combat.py flies
  it) with that state, once the client's create confirmation has arrived.
