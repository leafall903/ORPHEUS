# Runtime data

Prepared manual NPC catalogs may include a complete `mover` object from each
body's authored `STUCharacterMoverComponent`. `tools/extract_pve_npcs.py` exports
it with the existing source fingerprints. The explicit definition supplies NPC
combat capsule dimensions and movement values when the canonical hero table
does not contain that body. A partial or nonfinite mover object is rejected.
Older catalogs without this field retain their existing fallback behavior and
do not establish authored NPC hitbox or movement fidelity.

The server and its tests use the following data sets. The public source checkout uses separately prepared runtime data. See [separate deployment data](../README.md#separate-deployment-data).

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `schemas_174.json` | Layouts of 707 lobby messages in 87 protocol groups. |
| `retail_templates.json` | Decoded reference-server templates, including catalogs and prices; display-name markers are anonymized. |
| `extracted_items.json`, `extracted_general_unlocks.json` | Cosmetic names, types, rarity, categories and rewards. |
| `extracted_heroes.json` | Hero identifiers and names. |
| `extracted_maps.json` | Map metadata and seasonal variants. |
| `ai_spawners_174.json` | The training bots: each map's AI spawners (hero, team, place, route) and hint points, and the bot heroes' bodies, health and speed (`tools/extract_ai_spawners.py`). |
| `resource_keys_174.json` | Game content keys used by event resources. These are not account credentials. |
| `lobby_state_blob.key` | Local 64-byte signing input for the target build's lobby handshake. |
| `extracted_events_174.json` | Verified scene mappings used by regression tests. |
| `announced_crcs_174.json` | Protocol identifiers used by the schema-extraction tool. |
| `arcade_cards_174.json` | The Arcade's cards (`tools/extract_arcade_cards.py`). |
| `game_schemas_174.json`, `game_schemas_174.txt` | Layouts of the game link's messages (`tools/dump_schemas.py`). |
| `game_heroes_174.json` | Each playable hero's GUID, name and body (`tools/extract_game_heroes.py`). |
| `game_maps_174.json` | Each map's modes, server-owned placeables and spawn points (`tools/extract_game_maps.py`). |
| `game_queues_174.json` | The queue cards: modes, maps and team sizes (`tools/extract_game_queues.py`). |
| `game_graphs_174.json.gz` | The statescript graphs the game server runs (`tools/extract_game_graphs.py`). |
| `game_stats_174.json` | The stats the Tab board lists for each hero and mode (`tools/extract_game_stats.py`). |
| `game_movers_174.json` | Each hero body's character mover values (speeds, jump, gravity, capsule), from `tools/extract_game_movers.py`. |
| `collision_keys_174.json` | Storage keys of each map's collision chunk in build 104319, so the server can read the collision from your own game (`tools/build_collision.py`, cache in `cache/collision`). |
| `collision_props_174.json` | Storage keys of each map's props (fences, crates) and of their models, and which game modes keep which props; added to the same collision cache. |
| `statescript_codecs_174.json` | What the client reads for each statescript state class in a frame (property block and class reader, read in the client code by `tools/extract_statescript_codecs.py` in IDA); the encoder and the test reader use it. |
| `statescript_names_174.json` | Names for `tools/ssq.py`: class aliases (our research catalog and the VM code), the STU fields that hold a variable (OWLib's STU types), logical buttons, the hero select and HUD graphs, each game mode's scripts (the 1.74 0C5 assets) and the variable names the server code uses. |

The raw reference capture was from client 1.68 and was decoded using 1.74 schemas; templates are not a claim that every original live-service feature has been reproduced. The game client, raw captures and process dumps are not distributed here.

### Optional static ray geometry

In the prepared research checkout, use the local 104319 installation to generate the extra ray data for the selected maps.

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe tools\build_collision.py 0688 0CD3 --ray-geometry
```

The tool reads the installation from `game_path.txt` or an executable path given with `--game`. It writes `0688.rays.col` and `0CD3.rays.col` beside the existing movement caches. Runtime preparation copies each selected map's optional ray cache into the external pack and records its SHA-256.

Explicit static queries can use `collision.RayWorld.load(map_guid, mode_guid)`. It verifies the map and original chunk key, then selects props for the requested mode. A missing or mismatched cache produces a load error. Base coverage includes the core chunk and the supported static shapes in the existing prop index. Sphere and capsule props with positive uniform scale use analytic intersections. Nonuniformly scaled round props retain the existing triangle projection.

For a wider static query, use PowerShell 7 and the built DataTool from OWLib revision `7afe5f52706e7002ed8c2717299cd60846f3fa3a`. List unindexed client-made root definitions, export their local records and build the selected ray caches.

```powershell
$game = 'C:\path\to\Overwatch'
$dataTool = 'C:\path\to\owlib\DataTool\bin\Release\net6.0'
$records = 'C:\path\to\local-storage\ray-props.json'
$roots = @(.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe tools\build_collision.py 0688 0CD3 --list-unindexed-props | ConvertFrom-Json)
& ./tools/export_casc_records.ps1 -GameRoot $game -DataToolDir $dataTool -AssetGuid $roots -IncludeRootModels |
    Set-Content -LiteralPath $records -Encoding utf8
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe tools\build_collision.py 0688 0CD3 --ray-geometry --prop-records $records
```

The exporter verifies the selected definitions and models against the local content manifest, including both the container and the slice for bundled records. The cache builder reopens those records through CASC and resolves authored root model references in placeable order. It records the placement content key and the catalog's SHA-256 so changed inputs trigger a rebuild. The runtime pack uses the resulting cache without the local catalog. Attached child geometry, server-generated and dynamic objects, and authored ability filtering still need verification. Keep catalogs and generated caches local.

### Local raycast filter and receiver metadata

Use the build 104319 DataTool XML dumps for asset types `097` and `098` and the same pinned OWLib checkout. Keep the dumps and the JSON catalog outside the repository.

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe tools\extract_raycast_metadata.py 'C:\path\to\xml' --owlib 'C:\path\to\owlib' --output 'C:\path\to\local-storage\raycast-metadata.json'
```

The export checks that receiver overrides reference present filters. It retains ordered rules and references, distinguishes unset results from zero flags, and records a SHA-256 for each source XML file. Runtime interpretation of the rules and receiver results still needs separate evidence.

### Local score event metadata

Export the build 104319 `003F.054` settings from a DataTool `054` XML dump with the pinned OWLib checkout. Keep the output outside the repository.

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe tools\extract_game_stats.py 'C:\path\to\xml' --owlib 'C:\path\to\owlib' --score-events 'C:\path\to\score-events.json'
```

The export records the source hash, ordered label rows and `StatEventScoreScaler` rows. Event enums use the numeric values from the pinned types. Label rows retain text resource IDs, duplicate event aliases and anonymous fields for comparison with the original asset. The catalog gives event configuration. Thresholds, score decay, kill credit, and the message that carries an award to the HUD still require separate evidence.

### Additional statescript definitions

Use the build 104319 `003` and `01B` XML dumps and the pinned OWLib checkout to include additional entity definitions in a separate local graph bundle. Repeat `--entity` for each hexadecimal `003` asset index.

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -X utf8 tools\extract_game_graphs.py --xml 'C:\path\to\xml' --owlib 'C:\path\to\owlib' --entity 1403 --entity 143E --output 'C:\path\to\entity-graphs.json.gz'
```

The bundle's `entities` table holds the added definitions by full asset GUID. Their initial graphs retain definition order and use the same graph reference traversal as the hero catalog.

Add `--mode-xml 'C:\path\to\xml\0C5'` to the same extraction command to include the initial mode entity variables from build 104319. The output must be outside the repository. The server resolves these members by mode GUID, independently of the hero and mode schema defaults. Supply the bundle through `--game-graphs` when preparing the runtime.

To serve the bot spawn and death graphs from a prepared pack, include the six Practice Range bot body indexes `1403`, `143E`, `146E`, `14A9`, `14D2` and `14ED`, then pass the generated bundle to the runtime preparation tool. Point `ORPHEUS_RUNTIME_DIR` at the new pack when starting the server.

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe tools\prepare_server_runtime.py --source 'C:\path\to\local-research' --destination 'C:\path\to\orpheus-bot-runtime' --map 0688 --game-graphs 'C:\path\to\entity-graphs.json.gz'
```
