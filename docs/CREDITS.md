## Tools and related projects

- **[LizRollin's 1.74 runtime branch](https://github.com/LizRollin/overwatch-1.74-lobby-server/tree/9f8f3bcb5eccab6fb7738bee3c2371fcf0623f29)** —
  the expression interpreter, native statescript codecs, driver, character physics, collision,
  combat and associated tests evaluated and integrated at this pinned revision. Its MIT notice
  is retained. Upstream live-test claims and known defects are recorded separately from our local validation.
- **[AipNooBest's research](https://github.com/AipNooBest/overwatch-1.74-lobby-server/tree/f8426859c3195691d379f2fb291a475dfa40139e)** —
  additional body initialization and state-payload research used for comparison. Later HUD corrections
  were checked before using earlier conclusions.

- **[overtools / OWLib](https://github.com/overtools/OWLib)** — DataTool, TankLib, asset definitions and extraction tools used to inspect client data and prepare catalogs.
  The local target-build extraction also uses the `overwatch/1.74` source revision
  `7afe5f52706e7002ed8c2717299cd60846f3fa3a`, with its pinned TACTLib and revorbstd dependencies.
- **[overtools / TACTLib](https://github.com/overtools/TACTLib)** — CASC/TACT reading and related tooling used by the extraction toolchain.
- **[Plasmawatch](https://github.com/plasmawatch/login-server)** — Battle.net login-server emulation and protocol reference work.
- **[Prometheus](https://github.com/saturn-xvi/prometheus/tree/ad1fea7e6c04c9959c7115cb8ecd9c79c93c1ccb)** —
  early/beta Overwatch research, also compared here for controller/model associations,
  statescript structure and replication methods. Its beta component IDs and memory writes
  are not transplanted into the 1.74 server; it remains a separate project with its own license.
- **The authors of the community TLS relay** — the foundation of the relay used for the local retail connection.

## Rust migration and behavior references

- **Boi-027, Arlecchino and the upstream 1.74 server contributors** supplied the existing lobby handshake,
  JAM cipher and framing that serve as the Rust port's protocol reference. The original MIT notice is retained.
- **LizRollin and the original game runtime contributors** supplied the inherited game transport,
  float32 collision and character mover, statescript runtime and payload layouts, and the hitscan,
  predicted projectile and combat notice behavior used as Rust references. The pinned runtime
  source is listed above.
- **[RustCrypto](https://github.com/RustCrypto)** maintains the AES-GCM, HMAC and SHA-256 crates used by the Rust
  transport. **[The Rust Random Project](https://github.com/rust-random/getrandom)** supplies access to operating
  system randomness for the lobby challenge.
- **[Prost](https://github.com/tokio-rs/prost)** and **[prost-reflect](https://github.com/andrewhickman/prost-reflect)**
  supply protobuf framing and reflection over the external Battle.net descriptors.
- **[Tungstenite](https://github.com/snapview/tungstenite-rs)** supplies WebSocket framing for the local
  Battle.net listener.
- **[lzma-rust2](https://github.com/hasenbanck/lzma-rust2)** supplies XZ decoding for the movement
  and expanded-ray collision caches.
- **[Mio](https://github.com/tokio-rs/mio)** supplies portable UDP readiness polling and cross-thread
  wakeups for the Rust game worker.
- **[flate2](https://docs.rs/flate2/)** supplies gzip decoding for the external state graph bundle.
- **roxmltree** parses the local DragonML entity definitions used by the runtime preparation tool. [Project source](https://github.com/RazrFalcon/roxmltree)
- The statescript VM uses a deterministic SplitMix64 stream for local random expressions. The fixed-increment generator follows the public-domain implementation. [Sebastiano Vigna's SplitMix64](https://prng.di.unimi.it/splitmix.c)
- **TripleFault and Gamayun contributors** supplied a same-build comparison for encrypted combat scenarios and
  tick measurement design. The locally reviewed 104319 VM code in `internal/vm/natives.go` also corroborates
  the separate possessed-body and current-possessor queries and the health pool type selectors.
  Its `registry.go` and `states.go` provide behavior references for the synced game-code state,
  the tips state and the input bridge. Its `switch.go` and `instance.go` corroborate delayed
  branch timing and event ordering. Its `internal/world/health.go` provides an independent comparison
  for the component 51 fields and the provisional pool ID order. Gamayun identifies its Go implementation
  as AGPL-3.0-or-later and retains the MIT notice for inherited code.
- The frozen Python `ow174/game/onfire.py` and Gamayun's `internal/vm/natives.go` document the
  possessor's component 64 on-fire lookup. Gamayun's `internal/expr/value.go` provides a comparison
  for ordered map values and first-match lookup.
- The local build 104319 graphs exported with OWLib provide the single-tag grant and suppression
  paths in `01C7`, `01CF` and `0251`. Locally reviewed build 104319 codec tables from Gamayun and
  Boi-027's research corroborate the inherited empty payload for state `STU_E56BA8D8`.
- The local build 104319 graph bundles from Gamayun and Boi-027 and the OWLib exports corroborate
  the operands for the instance exit, absent AI state and zero-resource lookup. Local client
  155284 inspection provides the queued exit, parent completion and typed zero return evidence.
  The frozen 104319 state decoder and runtime provide finish-event and teardown comparisons.
- The build 104319 graph and codec tables corroborate the movement sampler's authored fields
  and 13-bit owner payload. Local 155284 client inspection identifies its movement-record inputs,
  changed-output writes and embedded record at owner context construction. The frozen 104319 mover
  provides a separate comparison for the airborne, crouch, ground-contact and jump flags.
- The frozen `ow174/game/projectiles.py` and `ow174/game/combat.py` provide the owner projectile
  lease, exact packet acknowledgement, release and swept flight references. The local build 104319
  Soldier weapon graph supplies Helix's authored lifetime, direct damage and splash settings.
- **The Claudewatch contributors** supplied the Beta 1.0.0.3 research lead for attacker-side hit-confirm effects
  and separate entity and announcer voice messages. ORPHEUS checks these leads against 104319 client data before
  implementing them. The reference is a locally reviewed binary distribution.

Thank you as well to everyone who shared captures, tools, notes, testing, corrections and encouragement, including contributors whose names were not recorded in the materials available to us. If a credit is missing or needs correcting, please open an issue so it can be fixed.

## Doomfist Hand Cannon

The 104319 volley graph defines eleven projectiles in three rings. Blizzard's patch notes
confirm eleven pellets at six damage and a 15-metre falloff start. The same launch class uses
a value of five for Torbjörn's secondary spread in the 104319 data, consistent with Blizzard's
description in degrees. The native azimuth and per-pellet angle variation still need a client
comparison.

## Doomfist movement sampling

The 104319 owner graph `01C7` writes the airborne variable read by Seismic Slam graph
`0B27`. Python uses the regular owner-pose sampling and output order already implemented
on ORPHEUS's Rust branch. [Movement sampler](https://github.com/leafall903/ORPHEUS/blob/13acf152e866bbea181074326551422ce9c86671/rust/src/mover.rs) ·
[Statescript runtime](https://github.com/leafall903/ORPHEUS/blob/13acf152e866bbea181074326551422ce9c86671/rust/src/script_init.rs)

## Rising Uppercut movement

The local 104319 graph export supplies the three velocity actions in graph `0DD8`.
The original client identifies their modifier dispatch at RVA `D2B643` and movement
phase at `C31870`. The ordinary body direction queries use the mover pose through
`C5E040` and `C62760`, and the direction limit evaluator is at `CEB820`.

## Rising Uppercut targets and damage

The local 104319 export supplies graph `0DD8`'s target filter, cast profile,
damage amount and loadout. The original client supplies the target query and
array update at RVA `CAE3B0`, capsule overlap at `C8E660` and sight query at
`CA3570`. The frame gate at `CA9460` and tick at `C95590` supply the query
cadence. The server reuses the sight query from the integrated communication
wheel work and the existing ORPHEUS combat pipeline.

The rank evaluator at RVA `1B77230` supplies the ordered target list.
Graph `0E7D` supplies the target's velocity action, airborne movement modifiers
and exit conditions. Delivery reuses the match's deferred body queue and the
loaded PlayScript path.

## Ability ground queries

The 104319 RayCast state binds its outputs at RVA `8EC210` and updates them at
`8EC270`. Its output accessor is at `C84580` and its end callback at `C841B0`.
The target-build `002C.097` profile supplies the static category mask for
Seismic Slam and Piledriver.

The 104319 state-switch evaluator at RVA `1B9B531` supplies indexed cases used
by Seismic Slam. The transition dependency path at `1B754D0` schedules the
state check through `1B71220`. The first-person anchor evaluator at `D1AB95` uses the stance
and mover spring. Doomfist's heights come from body `1235.003`. The static
selector write at `CB76C7` identifies the world-point form of MoveTo.

The local 104319 graph `0B27` supplies the close impact target and damage
states. The timer schedule at RVA `8E5A90` and the lower-priority callback at
`C880C0` inform the reconstructed server finish. The owner-relative centre
transform at `C9AFB0` and visibility fallback at `CAF254` inform the shared
capsule query.

The 104319 Shockwave callbacks at `C92510` and `C95270` supply the initial
and full-range samples. The query at `C99A80`, candidate filter at `CADA91`
and ground checks at `C9C810` inform the static reconstruction. The ground
support category comes from profile `0016.097`. The state writer at `C95C90`
supplies the optional auxiliary-list layout. TrackTargets at `CAF449` reads
the maximum result count from `m_C39691D9`.

## The Best Defense

The local 104319 graph export supplies the damage-dealt listener in `0DDD`,
the grant script `0DF3`, the named pool and its decay. The existing Summoner
damage sender supplies the typed message precedent. Blizzard's October 2019
notes record the normal 30-point grant.

## Wrecking Ball

The local 104319 statescript export supplies the authored Quad Cannons (`1514`),
Roll (`1203`) and Adaptive Shield (`1566`) settings. Blizzard's retail notes
describe the Roll speed increase, 100 base Adaptive Shield, 75 shield per nearby
enemy and nine-second duration.
