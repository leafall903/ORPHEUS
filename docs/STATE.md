# Project state

Local evidence from 2026-11-05, for client **1.74.0.0.104319**. This record
includes historical checkpoints. See the [changelog](../CHANGELOG.md) for
subsequent repairs and the [roadmap](ROADMAP.md) for current acceptance goals.
The gameplay integration uses LizRollin's wip revision
`9f8f3bcb5eccab6fb7738bee3c2371fcf0623f29`, on top of the Boi baseline and the
local startup/research work. [WIP.md](WIP.md) retains the upstream author's
test claims and known issues. Those claims are separate from the observations below.

Maintainer automation runs server work and offline checks. Volunteer client
playtests are a separate, manual verification lane described in
[CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md#original-client-verification).
The local server-only entry is `scripts/START_SERVER_LOCAL.cmd` / `--mode retail
--no-launch`; it retains the Battle.net/RPC/lobby/game services without a game
path, relay preparation or client-launch manager.

## Local client observations

- The real `_retail_/Overwatch.exe` logs into the local emulator without running
  the official Battle.net launcher.
- The Practice Range loads and the hero-selection screen appears. A hero switch
  was observed and recorded by the server.
- After the gameplay integration, the user reports killing training robots. The
  corresponding log records multiple damage notifications (25001), eliminations
  (25005), bot deaths and respawns.
- The user reports **no enemy overhead health bar**, no expected hit effect,
  and an elimination label without the robot's name. These remain unresolved.
  A robot's expected effect must be checked separately from flesh blood effects.

The automated UI check was stopped by the user with Escape. It did not establish
stable weapon/ammo HUD, a complete shooting/reload cycle, ten repeated hero
switches/reentries, or multiplayer agreement. Server logs and model tests do not
replace these client acceptance checks.

## Gameplay implementation now present

The canonical gameplay path uses `game/script/driver.py`, `runtime.py`,
`nodes.py` and `expr.py`, with target-build graph and codec data. It runs body,
weapon-manager and weapon instances and encodes owner/observer state frames.
It is no longer the earlier flat-movement/lobby-only implementation.

The imported implementation includes collision-based movement, hitscan and
projectiles, health pools, damage/death/respawn, Practice Range bots, and partial
hero abilities and match presentation. Each feature still needs scenario-specific
client validation. It does not constitute a complete game server or support all
heroes and match rules.

Local repairs add bounded expression execution and malformed-bytecode handling;
freeze reliable body creates to their original hero, skin, pose and projectile
lease; retire queued/in-flight entity records and ACK callbacks after destroy;
and reject late input packets without resetting only one command consumer.
Command decoding handles uint32 wrap. At this checkpoint the native body driver
rejected a forward wrap before changing its old-epoch timers and state. Later
server-driven handoff and global clock recovery work is recorded in the
[changelog](../CHANGELOG.md), with original-client recovery still to verify.

Runtime event/update exhaustion and immediate plug cycles now fail the entire
component with `ScriptBudgetError` (entity, frame and time included). Pending
shots/events are discarded and later command/snapshot/frame generation is
rejected. The live match handler retires that body's script; other players keep
running. This prevents half-completed simulations from looking successful. It
does not add automatic recovery or prove the cause of the reported live issues.

At the initial integration checkpoint, 1086 Python tests passed. The formerly skipped
King's Row physics case now runs with the locally built cache. A separate 62.448-second offline
Soldier sequence applied/decoded 3903 owner chunks, observed ammo spending and
seven refills, and ended with no active volley after release. This is a native
driver/local decoder model check, not real-client HUD or combat acceptance.

The Practice Range collision cache was built from this user's local CASC data:
`0688.col`, format 5, 470397 bytes, SHA-256
`dfdb71fbe9ad079d9d0b56fe12bd7c992a76c6ec942084d86f6388827f36a169`.
This proves cache extraction and loading inputs, not complete map collision fidelity.

All 95 catalog maps now have locally extracted, integrity-checked format-5 collision
caches. Workshop Green Screen uses a checked slice of its original CASC bundle;
both the container and asset content keys are verified. Matches now gate spawning
and simulation on an explicit ready state and keep their World after global LRU
eviction. Pending requests also keep their own completion handle. Movement, bots
and combat use the same match World. Load failure reports an unavailable state
and returns players rather than continuing with empty collision. Nine regressions
cover loading, walls, failed workers, concurrent matches and six pending requests.

Server and Match clocks and secure entropy now share an explicitly injectable
execution environment. The default still reads the original time/secrets sources
at each call. Ordered-read tests cover initialization, handoffs, pings and the
network loop. An explicit in-memory recording/replay wrapper preserves all six
read types, argument/callsite order and float bits, with permanent failure after
any mismatch. It has no default recording or file output; returned tapes can
contain private handoff keys. Fifteen wrapper tests pass. These are boundaries for
full battle replay, not a complete recorder or deterministic Match replay.

Body observation hashes now include lazy state-allocation order and the next
event sequence without consuming it. Button resync, teardown and volley reporting
traverse stored state order; equal-time events use sequence order. The isolated 975-command body
example still matches. The real Match's projectile-lease discovery also allocates
states after body creation; a body-only trace without that external operation now
correctly reports an incomplete boundary instead of hiding the difference. Full
Match capture must include that operation and its causal order.

An explicit controlled-server journal now replays real encrypted ingress through
the same GameServer router and captures API results, external-read positions,
send bytes/outcomes and callback order. Collision reads verify the materialized
World content; a source/table/runtime/config manifest rejects mismatched models.
A real Practice Range cache scenario moved out of spawn, eliminated a visible
training bot and observed its replacement after respawn; all86 controlled roots
and13 send attempts matched replay, with the largest datagram1189 bytes. No
game or network socket was started. This verifies controlled roots and wire;
complete_battle_replay and full_state_verified remain False.

The v2 journal adds an opt-in registered stored-state profile. It independently
compares hashes before and after each root, including VM event/timer order and
mutable identity, mover/contact/GJK state, combat and lifecycle state, stream
baselines, transport queues and callbacks. An unrecorded change between roots or
before the end fails the recording. A two-player encrypted protocol scenario
replays damage, death, respawn and hero selection with the registered state check.
The default wire-only profile remains available. The profile is not a live-loop
recorder or a snapshot of the whole process. See
[CONTROLLED_SERVER_JOURNAL_V2.txt](CONTROLLED_SERVER_JOURNAL_V2.txt) and
[SERVER_STORED_STATE_V1.txt](SERVER_STORED_STATE_V1.txt).

The new scenario exposed oversized native datagrams at spawn: the old budget
loop stopped at one entity although messages plus that entity exceeded1264 bytes.
Frame selection now permits zero entities, preserves ordered pending prefixes
and commits queues, correction tokens and remote-create visibility only after a
successful send. Known send errors retain queues while still consuming the nonce
sequence. Ch2-only projectile events no longer remain forever in the pending
queue. Nine dedicated packet-budget regressions pass. Individual records needing
unimplemented fragmentation are explicitly rejected and retained; see
[PACKET_BUDGET.txt](PACKET_BUDGET.txt) for this remaining limitation.

## Research and regression boundary

`script/research_runtime.py`, `script/body.py`, `script/replication.py`,
`game/simulation.py`, `game/flat_model.py` and `game/range_model.py` preserve
the earlier strict research, replay and geometry models. The live body driver
does not run through those prototypes. Their reports measure their stated
models; they are not a list of failures of the imported native gameplay runtime.

The v1 replay schema deliberately keeps its original seven input fields. Native
command extensions with non-default values require a newer recording contract;
the v1 adapter rejects them instead of silently losing information. See
[SIMULATION_CONTRACT.txt](SIMULATION_CONTRACT.txt).

Observed native body traces now have a separate v2 recording/replay path, including
all eleven decoded command fields, model/data fingerprints, stored-state and
shot-boundary checks, explicit retirement, and missing-input/fault/truncation
diagnostics. Movement log v2 also preserves windows before old/duplicate filtering.
These diagnostics are opt-in. A 975-command offline-generated body trace matched
its replay; it is not a full Match/combat/network capture. See
[NATIVE_BODY_REPLAY_V2.txt](NATIVE_BODY_REPLAY_V2.txt).

The repeated lifecycle protocol model covers ten Soldier/Reaper/Soldier round
trips and ten leave/rejoins. Real encrypted loopback UDP packets pass through the
production router and ACK handling, with an independent world-record reader
feeding the body decoder model. The cases exercise create/full ACK gates,
ordinary retransmission, retired records, observer references, fresh ammo/weapon
state, and old connection packets after reentry. This is backend protocol-model
acceptance; the user's real-client lifecycle/HUD checks remain separate.

## Remaining acceptance and implementation work

- Validate Soldier: 76 firing/reload and stable HUD for at least 60 seconds, then
  repeated hero switches and leaving/reentering the Practice Range.
- Resolve robot overhead bars, hit presentation and elimination-name lookup using
  target-build evidence. The bot body cannot accept player-only component 123.
- Recheck upstream defects: stuck firing/ammo after kills, Sprint eventually
  failing, crashes after kills, skin-dependent Biotic Field and stale HUD health.
  The new regression repairs are not proof that these live symptoms are cured.
- Establish two-client combat and loss/reordering acceptance, then complete mode
  phases, objectives, doors, health packs, match results and additional heroes.
- Verify real command-epoch transitions and owner-frame recovery. Do not infer a
  restart merely from a low frame in a late datagram.

## Local startup

`scripts/START_LOCAL.cmd` uses `.venv`, `--test-players 1` and `--bnet-port 1118`.
The relay RPC port is 21119. Passing an install folder or `Overwatch Launcher.exe` resolves to the
actual game executable. The original client files and launcher are retained.

## Lobby and data

The existing lobby includes menus/scenes, loot boxes, catalog purchases, profile
and cosmetic management, events/challenges, competitive menu data and the local
dashboard. See the upstream README for its scope.

`data/` in the local research checkout contains target-build schemas,
catalogs, graphs and data derived from 1.68 reference traffic decoded with 1.74
schemas. The [public data guide](../data/README.md) describes the separate runtime.
Cross-version references, unavailable specifications and evidence limits are recorded in
[RESEARCH_EVIDENCE.txt](RESEARCH_EVIDENCE.txt).
